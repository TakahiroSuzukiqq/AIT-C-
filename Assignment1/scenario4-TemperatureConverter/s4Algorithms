Scenario 4: Temperature Converter
1. Write a program that takes in three arguments
  1-1. A start temperature (in Celsius) 
  1-2. An end temperature (in Celsius)
  1-3. A step size
2. Print out a table that goes from the start temperature to the end temperature, 
3. In steps of the step size; you do not actually need to print the final end temperature 
   if the step size does not exactly match.


Algorithm
Step 1. Get a user input about float lowerLimit, higherLimit, stepSize and temperature
Step 2. Prepare tables with title "Celsius" and "Fahrenheit", and line "----".
Step 3. Display
   Step 3-1. On the top of the table, display user input lowerLimit temperature and its converted fahrenheit temperature.
   Step 3-2. Create a while loop which has a function to add temperature step size(stepSize) to lower temperature 
             while (lowerLimit + stepSize) < higherLimit. Display each of the result.
   Step 2-2. Inside the loop, functions are foollowing.
          Step 2-2-1. Add stepSize to user input lowerLimit.
          Step 2-2-2. Discribe fahrenheit converted formula.
          Step 2-2-3. Output the result of 2-2-1 and 2-2-2.
Step 4. The loop will be broken if variable lowerLimit reachs its number with user input higherLimit.
