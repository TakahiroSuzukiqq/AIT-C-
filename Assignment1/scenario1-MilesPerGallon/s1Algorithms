Scenario 1: Miles per Gallon
1. Write a program that will read in the "number of litres" of petrol consumed by the users car.
2. Writeb a program that will read in the "number of miles" traveled by the car. 
3. The program should then output the number of "miles per gallon" the car delivered.
4. You must show the outputs as given in the example.
5. You must show the numbers in "fixed point left justified" and in three decimal places as in the example


Algorithm
Step 1. Get a user input about variable litres and variable miles.
Step 2. Calculation.
   Step 2-1. Calculate traveled miles by multiplying litres and miles.
   Step 2-2. Calculate variable galon by multiplying constant galonPerLitre and variable litres.
   Step 2-3. Calculate variable amilesPergalon by deviding variable galon and variable miles.
Step 3. Display output.
