Task 1 
# include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

  int counter = 0;

//while {counter > 100}
  while (counter < 100) {
       if (counter % 2 == 1) {
            cout << counter << " is odd." << endl;
       //else
       } else {
          //cout << counter << " is odd." << endl;
            cout << counter << " is even." << endl;
         }
    ++counter;
  }

  system("pause");
  return 0;
}

======================================================
Task 2
Outputs about below code are `3, 4, 5`.
Inside the int while loop following calculation are operated.

Loop for the 1st time
I = I + 2 = -2 + 2 = 0
K = 5 - 1 = 4
I + K = 0 + 4 = 4

Loop for the 2nd time
I = I + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2
K = 4 - 1 = 3
I + K = 2 + 3 = 5

Loop for the 3rd time
I = I + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4
K = 3 - 1 = 2
I + K = 4 + 2 = 5

Loop for the 4rd time
I = I + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
K = 2 - 1 = 1
I + K = 6 + 1 = 7
But this time I = 6, greater than K so while loop breaks

# include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main () {
   
  int K = 5;
  int I = -2;
  
  while (I <= K) {
    I = I + 2;
    --K; 
    cout << (I + K) << endl;
  } 

  system("pause");
  return 0;
}

======================================================
Task 3
Outputs about below code are `3, 2, 1, 0, -1`.
Inside the int while loop following calculation are operated.

Loop for the 1st time
number 4 - 1 = 3

Loop for the 2nd time
number 3 - 1 = 2

Loop for the 3rd time
number 2 - 1 = 1

Loop for the 4th time
number 1 - 1 = 0

Loop for the 4th time
number 0 - 1 = -1

Loop for the 5th time
number -1 - 1 = -2
However while loop breaks when int number is less than -1
while loop only operate when int number is greater than 0 so this time loop is broken


# include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  
  int number = 4;
  
  while (number >= 0) {
     --number;
     cout << number << endl;
  } 

  system("pause");
  return 0;
}

Task 4
# include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  
  int n;

  cout << "Please enter multiplication size(1-15): " << endl; 
  cin >> n;
   
   cout << endl;

   for (int row = 1; row <= n; row++) {
       cout << " " << row;
   }
   cout << endl;
      
   for (int row = 1; row <= n; row++) {
       cout << row << " ";
      for (int col = 1; col <= n; col++) {
       cout << col * n <<  " ";
      }
     cout << endl;

    }
     cout << endl; 
    
    system("pause");
    return 0;
}
