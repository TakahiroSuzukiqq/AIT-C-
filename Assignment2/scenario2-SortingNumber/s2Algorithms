Algorithm
START
Step 1. Create an array with 10 int value.
Step 2. Create a function to compare each value inside the array one by one using a loop a function to display the value inside the array one by one,
        start from value 0 to value 9.
Step 3. If the number inside the array is smaller than the previous value swap these numbers by using temporary valuable.
        Using boolean False as a default.
Step 4. Once finish comparing every numbers inside the array, display the result using another loop which 
        also has a function to display the value inside the array one by one.
Step 5. Create same functions for an array with long value and an array with double value, iterate Step1 to 4.
