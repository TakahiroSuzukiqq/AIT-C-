Algorithm
START
Step 1. Get User input and store them into string.
Step 2. Check if user input contains vowels.
     2-1. Using for loop and search vowels from the first letter by measuring STRING NAME length with i.
          If user input contains vowels counter plus 1.
Step 3. Using tolower, toupper and isdegit functions to check whether user input string has lower case and upper case letters, or digit number.
        By measuring STRING NAME length with i, if user input has above one in the string, count one by one.
Step 4. Display each counter's number.
